# C Lenguage
* Structured type language
## Different uses of C
* App Softwares
* Drivers
* Embedded systems
* Firmware
* PIC's
## Creator
* Dennis Ritchie
## Lenguage Type
* Compiled language, for its use in different software some adjustments must be made in a code
## What is compiled language?
* A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code) and not interpreters (source code steppers, where no translation is performed at pre-execution).
## Language level
* Intermediate level language
## What is an Intermediate level language?
* They tend to be classified many times as high level, but allow certain low level management. They are necessary for certain applications such as the creation of operating systems, since they allow abstract handling (independent of the machine, unlike assembler), but without losing much of the power and efficiency that low-level languages have.
